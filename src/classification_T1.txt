Interrpretation of results Sprint 5.

The model has a poor performance, indicated by low F1-sores and accuracy.

For phishing (1) model performs decently high (recall of 0.83) meaning it 
identifies most phishing emails. However precision is low (0.50) meaning half
the emails it predicted as phishing were not actully phishing.

For non-phishing emails (0) the model performs poorly. Low recal (0.17).
Indicating that it misses most of the legitimate emails, wrongly predicting 
them as phishing. Precision is low (0.50) meaning only half is right.

The model absolutely needs improvement, its accuracy and metrics suggest 
failure to predict non-phishing emails accurately.

Must balance dataset better.
Model tune to refine the model.
