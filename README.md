#### Enron Email Dataset
Earlier stages of development made use of the **Enron Email Dataset**, originally compiled and released by the **CALO Project** at **Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)**. The dataset was made public as part of the U.S. **Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s** investigation and was intended for academic and scientific research.

For this project, the dataset was accessed via [**Kaggle**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wcukierski/enron-email-dataset) (Wcukierski, 2019), where it is available for research and educational use.
